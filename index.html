**Step 1**  
Step 1 in AA is about conceding to our innermost selves that we are alcoholics. For me, that meant shifting my perspective from feeling sorry for myself to embracing the idea that I *get* to be an alcoholic. Recognizing that I have an addictive personality helped me understand where I needed to focus my work: on the rest of the 12 Steps, connecting with God, improving myself, and letting go of long-held resentments, fears, anxieties, and depression. Some sponsors suggest making two lists—how alcohol made you powerless and how it made your life unmanageable—but my real challenge was fully accepting that I was an alcoholic, rather than constantly searching for ways to drink “like a normal person.”

**Step 2**  
Step 2 is about coming to believe that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity. Initially, I didn’t want to concede that alcohol, drugs, and my behavior had made me insane. I also wrestled with the concept of God, feeling like He was akin to Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy. Many people in recovery use different conceptions of God—“group of drunks,” “good orderly direction,” or something else. Over time, I came to see God as Love and as the energy permeating the universe, present in everyone and everything. I believe God speaks to me through people, experiences, and especially my intuition. It took a long time to arrive at this view, and staying connected to that belief is an ongoing effort.

**Step 3**  
Step 3 is about turning our will and our lives over to God as we understand Him. This was one of the hardest steps for me. I eventually realized that I need to recommit to it every single day. Each morning, I pray for guidance in my thoughts and actions, because *my will and my life* really boil down to my *thoughts and actions*. I believe God’s will for me is to become the best version of myself and to help others. It’s easy to slip back into “my will,” so I keep this step active by praying, believing, and trusting the intuition that nudges me toward the next right action.

**Step 4**  
Step 4 involves making a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. I found it easy to obsess over my shortcomings in my head, but when I finally put them on paper, prayed over them, and shared with my sponsor, I felt tremendous relief. I also believe this step benefits from being revisited multiple times throughout recovery. As I stay sober and continue working the other steps, new realizations about my past come to light. Often, these insights emerge when I’m guiding someone else through their Step 4.

**Step 5**  
Step 5 is about admitting to God, ourselves, and another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. Practically, it involves reviewing our Step 4 inventory with a sponsor and praying about it. This openness and honesty help release the shame and guilt that can keep us stuck.

---

**Steps 6 and 7**  
Steps 6 and 7 focus on becoming entirely ready for God to remove our defects of character, and then humbly asking Him to do so. They are closely tied, and it can be easy to confuse their exact wording or meaning. Essentially, Step 6 is about willingness, and Step 7 is about surrender—asking God for help in truly letting go of these character defects.

**Step 8**  
Step 8 involves making a list of all the people we have harmed and becoming willing to make amends to them. Like Step 4, this step can expand over time as I remember more instances or recognize the impact of my past actions more clearly. Although Step 8 sounds intimidating, it’s primarily the preparation phase—Step 9 is often where the real fear comes in.

---

**Step 9**  
Step 9 is where we actually make direct amends, unless doing so would harm others. In my experience, the amends I’ve made have gone better than I expected. They’ve restored and improved relationships and have sometimes opened doors I never imagined. Making these amends brought me relief and a deeper understanding of both myself and the people I harmed.

---

**Step 10**  
Step 10 asks us to continue taking personal inventory and promptly admit when we’re wrong. For me, this often involves daily reflection on resentments, fears, and situations where I might need to make amends. Continually revisiting the previous steps and guiding others through them also keeps me accountable and aware of my own growth areas.

---

**Step 11**  
Step 11 focuses on prayer (talking to God) and meditation (listening to God). I don’t always practice these as much as I should, but I notice a clear difference on days I begin with prayer and meditation. I also believe our thoughts can be a form of prayer, so monitoring my mindset is important. I like to have ongoing, free-form conversations with God in my head, and I practice mindfulness by living in the present moment—where I find God’s presence more accessible. Dwelling on the past often leads me to depression, and future worries stir up anxiety, so focusing on *now* keeps me connected.

**Step 12**  
Step 12 is about carrying the message to other alcoholics and practicing these principles in all our affairs. It’s usually easier to practice these principles while in meetings or when I’m helping someone else in recovery. The real test comes in my everyday life, especially at home or when I’m on my own. Showing up to meetings, engaging in service work, and being available to help newcomers are all ways I keep Step 12 alive.
